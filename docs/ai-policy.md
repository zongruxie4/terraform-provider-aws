# AI Policy

Community contributions, including AI-assisted changes are welcome.
When using AI, please be cognizant that a small team of maintainers are responsible for reviewing _all_ proposed changes to this codebase.

AI will not optimize for maintainability and often lacks understanding of the broader design principles for the project, especially when prompted to fix a specific bug.
The human author is responsible for making these considerations and editing AI output as appropriate.

Submissions which do not adhere the guidelines discussed in the contributor guide **will be closed without review or comment.**
